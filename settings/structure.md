# §dBlingBling Addons
### All ct modules must be compliant with hypixel rules in order to be verified.
Additionally, I would like to separate the feature from the mod for people who do not intend to use it.
As a result, structure check would not be possible to implement while making blingbling addons ct verifiable.
If you would like to install structure check, please follow these installation instructions
1. Go to this link [github](https://github.com/blingblingdeveloper/blingblingaddonsstruccheck/tree/main).
2. Code -> Download as zip
3. Unzip the file, and drag the folder inside the new folder into your modules folder
3. Drag the zip file into your modules folder
This code is completely open source, however please note that it has §4not §4been verified by the ctjs team and against hypixel rules.

## §dWhy Structure Grief was added
I added this to encourage people not to cheat/use more malicious mods which have structure check or esp, which will tempt them into malicious forms of mining such as macroing and grotto esp. I also made this because I did not want people to rage and then download some super suspicious mod that will get them ratted or complain about why blingbling sapphire 24 vein was getting griefed.
